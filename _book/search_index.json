The course sessions will allow you to decode some of the major issues of the digital world by mobilizing knowledge in history, sociology and political science . At the same time, we will conduct practical code exercises during the course sessions around data manipulation and writing in digital formats. These two learning processes, knowing digital cultures and practicing digital technology, will be used for the main exercise of the course, that of producing a digital exploration in a small group. This will involve conducting an investigation on a specific topic that you have defined and reporting on your investigation digitally. 1.1 VALIDATION METHOD Participation (bonus : +1 maximum) You will be expected to be actively engaged during the course and to intervene regularly to enrich the collective discussions. However, your participation grade will not be based solely on your speaking in class. *The quality of your listening and attention will also be taken into account You will also be able to participate “digitally” by sending articles, reflections, etc. to other students in the class in the course discussion groups (emails, Google Docs, etc.). Individual exercise (30%) - Deadline : 29/09/2022 (class 5) For the 5th session (29/09/2022), you will write a note based on the reading of a scientific article or a book chapter. Your note should be no longer than 500 words (one page). The scientific article should be related to your exploration theme: from this article, you will have to extract a concept, write a synthetic note on the notion (fact, theory, case study) and explain why this concept is relevant to your exploration. The articulation between the concept studied and its resonance in your final project will be the main criterion for evaluating this exercise. You will need to be as specific as possible, without getting lost in too many general statements. Your paper should be uploaded here (you’ll find the submission application at session 5) Digital exploration (70%) – Deadline : 27/10/2022, one week after the last class In groups of 3 or 4, you will have to conduct an investigation on a digital practice, service, company, etc. The restitution of your exploration will have to be done in a digital format (website, video, podcast, but also possibly Facebook account, Instagram, etc.). This file must be based on bibliographic and webographic research. It should include a presentation of your problematic, your investigation methods (interviews, online questionnaire, experimental protocols, online ethnography, etc.); your analyses and interpretations; as well as a synthesis of the results obtained. If your exploration should focus on the digital world and your restitution has to take a digital format, you may use investigation methods of your own choice, depending on your abilities. WORKLOAD The main workload of this course is the group completion of the digital exploration. But each class session also requires preparation.
